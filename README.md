Taco PHP - Featherweight MVC Framework

Looking at CodeIgniter, I thought to myself that this could be done simpler, easier to use and with less files cluttering up my web root.

Taco is a featherweight PHP mvc framework. Only the very basics are baked in, such as Smarty for templating (optional, basic PHP as templing is supported as well), MySqliDB database handling class (https://github.com/joshcam/PHP-MySQLi-Database-Class) and a simple RegExp based routing system fulfilling all the routing needs I've ever had.

Currently considering baking LESS support in as well.
